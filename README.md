# urban-build-up prediction
Introduction
This project aims to predict the urban build-up of an area over the next 10 years using Machine Learning techniques. By analyzing historical development data, the model provides insights into future urbanization patterns, which can help in urban planning and development strategies.

Project Objective
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that estimates the future urban build-up of a region based on past trends and data.

**Features**

Predicts urban build-up for the next decade.
Uses historical data to analyze urbanization trends.
Provides data visualization for better understanding and interpretation.
**Technology Stack**
Programming Language: Python

**How It Works**

**Data Collection:** Collect historical urban development data from reliable sources.
**Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data for training.
**Model Development:** Train a machine learning model using algorithms such as regression or neural networks.
**Prediction**: Use the model to forecast urban build-up over the next 10 years.
**Evaluation:** Evaluate the accuracy of predictions using performance metrics.
